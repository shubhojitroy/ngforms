        <h4>Reactive Forms</h4>
        <p>
          <em>Reactive forms</em> provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over
          time. This guide shows you how to create and update a simple form control, progress to using multiple
          controls in a group, validate form values, and implement more advanced forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reactive forms use an explicit and immutable approach to managing the state of a form at a given point in
          time. Each change to the form state returns a new state, which maintains the integrity of the model between
          changes. Reactive forms are built around observable streams, where form inputs and values are provided as
          streams of input values, which can be accessed synchronously.<br><br>Reactive forms also provide a
          straightforward path to testing because you are assured that your data is consistent and predictable when
          requested. Any consumers of the streams have access to manipulate that data safely.<br><br>Reactive forms
          differ from template-driven forms in distinct ways. Reactive forms provide more predictability with
          synchronous access to the data model, immutability with observable operators, and change tracking through
          observable streams. If you prefer direct access to modify data in your template, template-driven forms are
          less explicit because they rely on directives embedded in the template, along with mutable data to track
          changes asynchronously. See the Forms Overview for detailed comparisons between the two paradigms.
